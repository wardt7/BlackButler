# BlackButler
BlackButler was an A2 Level Computing project by Toby Ward, which has facilities for enciphering and deciphering messages, password creation, and frequency analysis features.

Hi!

If you're interested in using this program, download the entire project and run the interface.py file.

The cipher.py file can also be used as a message enciphering module, and requires the MorseLatinCode.txt and WabunCode.txt files in order to function.
